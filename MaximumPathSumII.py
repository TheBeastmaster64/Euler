# We will put the whole structure in an array or arrays.
# This is a tree-like structure but two nodes can share children
# The left child of triangle[i][j] = triangle[i+1][j]
# Similarly, the right child is triangle[i+1][j+1]
# We start adding from the bottom thus only going each element once, making our algorithm O(n)
# Example:
#              3         ->           3       ->      3     ->    23

#           7    4                 7    4          20  19
#         /   \/  \              /   \/  \
#        2    4    6            10   13   15
